  <p>
    There are essentially two broad cases to consider in order to discuss WebSpecs. Either you have
    a bug against a specific aspect of a given specification, or you have a more general proposal
    that may be a new feature in an existing specification (WebSpec or not) or even a suggestion for
    a completely new WebSpec.
  </p>
  <section>
    <h2>Reporting Bugs</h2>
    <p>
      This is the easiest case. Bugs for specifications are handled in the GitHub issue tracker that
      goes with the repository. (Note that this applies to <em>all</em> parts of the projects, not
      just specs. For instance, this documentation can be improved in
      <a href="https://github.com/webspecs/docs/issues">its own repository</a>.) If you go to any
      WebSpec, right under the big title is a line with a list of links. Click on “bugs” and you’ll
      be right where you need to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The content of your bug report should be the same as for any other bug report. Be clear,
      concise, and complete. Point out what you expected and what you are seeing instead. Explain
      what the problem is based on a use case. Keep the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/">HTML Design Principles</a> in mind
      (even if your bug has nothing to do with HTML), notably the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies">Priority of
      Constituencies</a>. Be kind and polite (<a href="/docs/policy/anti-jerk.html">or else…</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      There is only one small complicating factor compared to a typical bug report. Some WebSpecs
      will be forks of others, and in some situations the bug would be better filed on another one.
      If the distinction is obvious to you, just keep it in mind, otherwise just file on the
      document you were reading and people will move it if need be — better a bug in the wrong place
      than missed.
    </p>

    <h2>Discussing New Ideas</h2>
    <p>
      For obvious reasons, completely new ideas cannot be discussed as bugs against a given
      specification since presumably that specification does not exist in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in the case in which there happens to be an existing repository, if the novel idea you
      wish to discuss is broad enough in its reach it can be useful to bring it to the full
      community rather than restrict its discussion to the smaller number of people who will be
      tracking issues against a specific document.
    </p>
    <p>
      In either case, the best place at which to conduct such a discussion is at the community's
      Discourse instance at 
      <a href="http://discourse.specifiction.org/">http://discourse.specifiction.org/</a>. (Note that
      it is expected to move to https://discourse.webplatform.org/ in the relatively close future.)
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have used Web forums before and you still want to claw your own eyes out from the
      distress it has caused you, do not be alarmed. Discourse is forums reinvented. It is pleasant
      to use; in fact you will likely want to come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simply create an account there and get started. Beginning users have a few restrictions on
      their accounts (such as number of links per post) in order to limit spam, but those get lifted
      quickly as you interact with others (and you can ask the admins to bump your karma).
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not be afraid. No one will be mean to you if your post contains an error, or if you are
      suggesting something that has been explored and abandoned before. There are many Web standards
      and they have a rich history; no one is expected to know everything, and we would rather have
      good ideas at the cost of a little noise than the other way around.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are only a few rules for participation. First, exchanges there are under our strict
      <a href="/docs/policy/anti-jerk.html">anti-jerk policy</a>. If you are mean to others there will
      be consequences, if you see others being mean please report that to the admins (posts can be
      flagged). Second, the forum is for discussion of new ideas or problems with Web standards, not
      to ask questions about how to use something or how to make a browser work with your code.
      There's StackOverflow for that!
    </p>
    <p>
      That's it! Several of the discussions there have already influenced existing and upcoming
      standards — all it takes for more of the same to happen is for you to join and talk.
