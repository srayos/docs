  <p>
    Web standards sorely suffer from lack of input from Web developers; yet, at this time,
    contributing to standards remains unnecessarily daunting. WebPlatform Specs — or “WebSpecs” for
    short — aims to progressively build up both the technical solution and the community involvement
    to address this issue.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project is not a replacement or a competitor but rather a complement to W3C, WHATWG, TC-39,
    the IETF, or whichever standards organisation may be in charge of this or that bit of the
    platform. As such, it is <em>emphatically not</em> an
    <a href='http://xkcd.com/927/'><code>xkcd:927</code></a> alternative to existing solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The basic idea is simple: this project provides a friendly environment for anyone to contribute
    to the creation and development of standards, built atop tools and workflows meant to be
    familiar to Web developers. Care is taken to ensure that the legal requirements involved in
    contributing to given standards are fulfilled without getting in the way. Then whatever magic is
    required to get a document produced here published on a standard track within a given
    organisation is then handled as much as possible behind the scenes.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may note that the word “friendly” may come up regularly here. That is no fluke. Standards
    discussions are often plagued by negativity, distrust, and stop-energy. The standards world is
    fraught with useless drama. This has a tendency to drive away many would-be contributors as
    few people have the desire to endure abuse for no good reason when all they want is to make the
    Web a better place.
  </p>
  <p>
    That is something that has to stop. In this project, we take friendly, constructive interactions
    very seriously and we take a <em>very dim view</em> of invidious comments. If you notice
    unfriendly behaviour, please flag it as such as it will not be tolerated. For more details,
    you can see our <a href='/policy/anti-jerk.html'>anti-jerk policy</a>.

    <h2>Core Principles</h2>
    <p>
      Web standards have flourished in large part through their openness. A core tenet of WebSpecs
      is to create standards that are fully open, matching the needs and habits of the Web
      community. This builds on the following principles:

        Up until a few years ago, forking was perceived as a mode of failure. Today, it is a mode of
        collaboration: <em>Make Forks Not War</em>.

        Standard organisations often start off flexible and smart, but over time collectively suffer
        from a slow, toxic drift towards dumb adherence to rules over thoughtful consideration of
        goals. It is a continuing goal of WebSpecs to avoid this drift, to keep the amount of rules
        to a strict minimum, and to always leave room for intelligent discussion amongst smart,
        constructive adults.

        There is only one difference between a WebSpecs specification sitting in a topic branch or
        on anyone's fork and one that's taken into the <code>master</code> branch of a 
        <a href='https://github.com/webspecs'>webspecs repository</a>: testing. If a specification
        has a good enough (for sane values of “good enough”, perfection not being of this world) 
        test suite in our sister <a href='https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/'>Web Platform
        Tests</a> project and that test suite has a <em>good enough</em> pass ratio in at least a
        couple of major browsers, then that specification is good to merge to <code>master</code>.
        Otherwise, it's a proposal.
