    <strong>Web developers</strong> create most of the Web’s magic, yet they are almost absent from the process of
    creation of core Web technology. <strong>Web standards</strong> suffer sorely from Web developers’ absence; yet,
    at this time, contributing to standards remains unnecessarily daunting.
    <strong>Web Platform Specs</strong> — or “WebSpecs” for short — aims to progressively build up both the
    technical solution and the community involvement to address this issue.

    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>
      This project is not a replacement or a competitor but rather a complement to <a
      href="http://w3.org/">W3C</a>, <a href="https://whatwg.org/">WHATWG</a>, <a
      href="http://www.ecmascript.org/">TC-39</a>, the <a href="http://ietf.org/">IETF</a>, or
      whichever standards organisation may be in charge of this or that bit of the platform. As
      such, it is <em>emphatically not</em> an <a
      href="http://xkcd.com/927/"><code>xkcd:927</code></a> alternative to existing solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our idea is simple: this project provides a welcoming environment for anyone to contribute to
      the creation and development of standards, using tools and workflows familiar to Web
      developers. We take care to ensure that the legal requirements involved in contributing to
      given standards are fulfilled without getting in the way. Then whatever dark magic is required
      to get a document produced here published on a standard track within a given organisation does
      not interfere with the fun work of creating Web standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historically, standards discussions have often been plagued by negativity, distrust, and
      stop-energy. The standards world is fraught with useless drama and what often looks like petty
      turf wars. This drives away many would-be contributors since sane people rarely wish to endure
      abuse for no good reason when all they want is to make the Web a better place.
    </p>
    <p>
      That stops here.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this project, we take friendly, constructive interactions very seriously and we take a
      <em>very dim view</em> of invidious comments. If you notice unfriendly behaviour, please flag
      it as such as it will not be tolerated. For more details, you can see our <a

    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <p>
      The project is still in its early phase, there is much that has yet to be put into place,
      but the adventurous can get started!
    </p>
    <p>
      More specifically:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The new specification style has started being used, and a small number of specifications are
        being added to the <a href="/">Web Platform index page</a>. More are on their way!
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://discourse.specifiction.org/">Online discussion for proposals</a> works (it
        will be migrated to a new location but the content will be kept).
      </li>
      <li>
        The <a href="https://github.com/webspecs">GitHub organisation</a> is up and running, and you
        can already jump in to help.
      </li>
      <li>Automatic publishing based off GitHub repositories is operational.</li>
      <li>The documentation needs work, but is being written.</li>
      <li>
        Support tooling to create specifications is available, notably
        <a href="https://github.com/webspecs/webspec">to create and validate specifications</a> and
        to <a href="https://github.com/webspecs/bikeshed">generate them</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Our sister project <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/">Web Platform
        Tests</a> (backed by the <a href="http://testthewebforward.org/">Test The Web Forward</a>
        events) is operational. It provides the testing infrastructure for Web Platform Specs.

    <h2>Community &amp; Support</h2>
    <p>
      Getting started can be a bit daunting. If you're hesitant, or if you have any question, simply
      either:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Bring up your issue on <a href="https://discourse.specifiction.org/">Discourse</a>, there
        are always helpful people there ready to give you a hand; or
      </li>
      <li>
        Come hang out on IRC, channel <a href="irc://freenode.net/webspecs">#webspecs on the
        Freenode.net network</a>, it's a small gang of friendly people who'll help you out; or
      </li>
      <li>
        If all else fails, ping <a href="https://twitter.com/robinberjon">Robin</a> on Twitter and
        he'll figure something out.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In any case, don't be shy and don't be scared! No one will bite your head off, and if they try
      we'll handle them, as per the <a href="policy/anti-jerk.html">anti-jerk policy</a>.

    <h2>How Things Work</h2>
    <p>
      If you really want to get involved you will want to read the more complete documentation
      in the <a href="how-to/">how-to section</a>. But here’s the summary version.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those simply interested in <strong>reading specifications and ongoing proposals</strong>,
      they are <em>all</em> linked from the Web Platform Specs index at the root of <a
      href="/">https://specs.webplatform.org/</a>. You can see this as the one-stop-shop for all
      specifications produced by this project. Eventually we are considering turning this into the
      single entry point for all specifications that define the platform irrespective of where they
      originate, but that is still under discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wish to <strong>propose or discuss ideas</strong> that aren't clearly bugs against a
      specific document, then our <a href="https://discourse.org/">Discourse</a> instance at <a
      href="http://discourse.specifiction.org/">http://discourse.specifiction.org/</a> (no, it’s not
      a typo and the address will change) is perfect for that. It already has an active community,
      without being noisy either. If the mere words “online forum” are enough to fill you with the
      sort of dread that only the combined power of terrible design and blinking emoticons can
      raise, then fear not. We are like you. This specific forum is not like that. It is lovely to
      use, pretty to look at, and discussions are eminently civilised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, for those wishing to <strong>work on an actual specification</strong> things are a
      little bit more involved, but it's very little you won't be familiar with anyway if you've
      done open source development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifications are written in a Markdown variant known as <a
      href="https://github.com/webspecs/bikeshed">Bikeshed</a>, by the most excellent Tab Atkins. It
      takes care of a lot of the boring stuff involved in specifications, such as cross-references,
      consistent styling, numbered sections and tables of contents, and much, much more.
    </p>
    <p>
      To file a bug against a specification, just do so in its GitHub repository (the link will be
      at the top). If you wish to propose a relatively simple change, then simply make a pull
      request, as usual. If however the change you are proposing is a little more involved and
      would benefit from broader community review, then you will want to keep your fork separate
      while it is discussed and for that to have it included in the index as a proposal. That's
      straightforward: it's a simple matter of making a pull request against
      <a href="https://github.com/webspecs/the-index">the index</a> to include a link to your
      proposal, using a very simple format.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to start a specification from scratch, the process is just about the same. You need
      to create a repository of your own (it does not have to be under the “webspecs” organisation),
      being careful to give it a sensible name as that is what will be used to identify it in the
      system. We recommend that you use the <a
      href="https://github.com/webspecs/webspec"><code>webspec</code></a> tool to make sure that it
      is set up properly. Once you've written up enough that you would consider sharing it with the
      world, simply make a pull request to have it linked to from
      <a href="https://github.com/webspecs/the-index">the index</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing that is important to note: we ascribe specific meaning to some <code>git</code>
      branches. We reserve <code>master</code> for specifications that are well supported in
      implementations (as demonstrated using a credible test suite) and <code>develop</code>
      for specifications that are in the process of being implemented by vendors (i.e. they have
      shown genuine interest and some buggy, partial code is being worked on). For specifications
      that are still just proposals, please use any other branch name.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's it! Or at least, that's all you need to understand to get started. We are building
      extensive documentation. And like everything we do, if you don't like it,
      <a href="https://github.com/webspecs/docs">fork it and send us a pull request</a>!
    </p>
    <p>
      Enjoy the ride!
