    Web standards sorely suffer from lack of input from Web developers; yet, at this time,
    contributing to standards remains unnecessarily daunting. WebPlatform Specs — or “WebSpecs” for
    short — aims to progressively build up both the technical solution and the community involvement
    to address this issue.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project is not a replacement or a competitor but rather a complement to W3C, WHATWG, TC-39,
    the IETF, or whichever standards organisation may be in charge of this or that bit of the
    platform. As such, it is <em>emphatically not</em> an
    <a href='http://xkcd.com/927/'><code>xkcd:927</code></a> alternative to existing solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The basic idea is simple: this project provides a friendly environment for anyone to contribute
    to the creation and development of standards, built atop tools and workflows meant to be
    familiar to Web developers. Care is taken to ensure that the legal requirements involved in
    contributing to given standards are fulfilled without getting in the way. Then whatever magic is
    required to get a document produced here published on a standard track within a given
    organisation is then handled as much as possible behind the scenes.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may note that the word “friendly” may come up regularly here. That is no fluke. Standards
    discussions are often plagued by negativity, distrust, and stop-energy. The standards world is
    fraught with useless drama. This has a tendency to drive away many would-be contributors as
    few people have the desire to endure abuse for no good reason when all they want is to make the
    Web a better place.
  </p>
  <p>
    That is something that has to stop. In this project, we take friendly, constructive interactions
    very seriously and we take a <em>very dim view</em> of invidious comments. If you notice
    unfriendly behaviour, please flag it as such as it will not be tolerated. For more details,
    you can see our <a href='/policy/anti-jerk.html'>anti-jerk policy</a>.
