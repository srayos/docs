    <strong>Web developers</strong> create most of the Web’s magic, yet they are almost absent from the process of
    creation of core Web technology. <strong>Web standards</strong> suffer sorely from Web developers’ absence; yet,
    at this time, contributing to standards remains unnecessarily daunting.
    <strong>Web Platform Specs</strong> — or “WebSpecs” for short — aims to progressively build up both the
    technical solution and the community involvement to address this issue.

    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>
      This project is not a replacement or a competitor but rather a complement to <a href="http://w3.org/">W3C</a>, <a href="https://whatwg.org/">WHATWG</a>, <a href="http://www.ecmascript.org/">TC-39</a>, the <a href="http://ietf.org/">IETF</a>, or
      whichever standards organisation may be in charge of this or that bit of the platform. As
      such, it is <em>emphatically not</em> an <a href="http://xkcd.com/927/"><code>xkcd:927</code></a> alternative to existing solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our idea is simple: this project provides a welcoming environment for anyone to contribute to
      the creation and development of standards, using tools and workflows familiar to Web
      developers. We take care to ensure that the legal requirements involved in contributing to
      given standards are fulfilled without getting in the way. Then whatever dark magic is required
      to get a document produced here published on a standard track within a given organisation does
      not interfere with the fun work of creating Web standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historically, standards discussions have often been plagued by negativity, distrust, and
      stop-energy. The standards world is fraught with useless drama and what often looks like petty
      turf wars. This drives away many would-be contributors since sane people rarely wish to endure
      abuse for no good reason when all they want is to make the Web a better place.
    </p>
    <p>
      That stops here.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this project, we take friendly, constructive interactions very seriously and we take a
      <em>very dim view</em> of invidious comments. If you notice unfriendly behaviour, please flag
      it as such as it will not be tolerated. For more details, you can see our <a href="policy/anti-jerk.html">anti-jerk policy</a>.

    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <p>
      The project is still in its early phase, there is much that has yet to be put into place,
      but the adventurous can get started!
    </p>
    <p>
      More specifically:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The new specification style has started being used, and a small number of specifications are
        being added to the <a href="/">Web Platform index page</a>. More are on their way!
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://discourse.specifiction.org/">Online discussion for proposals</a> works (it
        will be migrated to a new location but the content will be kept).
      </li>
      <li>
        The <a href="https://github.com/webspecs">GitHub organisation</a> is up and running, and you
        can already jump in to help.
      </li>
      <li>Automatic publishing based off GitHub repositories is operational.</li>
      <li>The documentation needs work, but is being written.</li>
      <li>
        Support tooling to create specifications is available, notably
        <a href="https://github.com/webspecs/webspec">to create and validate specifications</a> and
        to <a href="https://github.com/webspecs/bikeshed">generate them</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Our sister project <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/">Web Platform
        Tests</a> (backed by the <a href="http://testthewebforward.org/">Test The Web Forward</a>
        events) is operational. It provides the testing infrastructure for Web Platform Specs.

    <h2>Core Principles</h2>
    <p>
      Web standards have flourished in large part through their openness. A core tenet of WebSpecs
      is to create standards that are fully open, matching the needs and habits of the Web
      community. This builds on the following principles:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt id="forkable">Forkable</dt>
      <dd>
        Up until a few years ago, forking was perceived as a mode of failure. Today, it is a mode of
        collaboration: <em>Make Forks Not War</em>.

      <dd>
        
      </dd>
      <dt id="thoughtful">Thoughtful</dt>
      <dd>
        Standard organisations often start off flexible and smart, but over time collectively suffer
        from a slow, toxic drift towards dumb adherence to rules over thoughtful consideration of
        goals. It is a continuing goal of WebSpecs to avoid this drift, to keep the amount of rules
        to a strict minimum, and to always leave room for intelligent discussion amongst smart,
        constructive adults.

      <dd>
        There is only one difference between a WebSpecs specification sitting in a topic branch or
        on anyone’s fork and one that’s taken into the <code>master</code> branch of a 
        <a href="https://github.com/webspecs">webspecs repository</a>: testing. If a specification
        has a good enough (for sane values of “good enough”, perfection not being of this world) 
        test suite in our sister <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/">Web Platform
        Tests</a> project and that test suite has a <em>good enough</em> pass ratio in at least a
        couple of major browsers, then that specification is good to merge to <code>master</code>.
        Otherwise, it’s a proposal.
