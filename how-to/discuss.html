    There are essentially two broad cases to consider in order to discuss WebSpecs. Either you have
    a bug against a specific aspect of a given specification, or you have a more general proposal
    that may be a new feature in an existing specification (WebSpec or not) or even a suggestion for
    a completely new WebSpec.
  </p>

    <h2>Reporting Bugs</h2>
    <p>
      This is the easiest case. Bugs for specifications are handled in the GitHub issue tracker that
      goes with the repository. (Note that this applies to <em>all</em> parts of the projects, not
      just specs. For instance, this documentation can be improved in
      <a href="https://github.com/webspecs/docs/issues">its own repository</a>.) If you go to any
      WebSpec, right under the big title is a line with a list of links. Click on “bugs” and you’ll
      be right where you need to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The content of your bug report should be the same as for any other bug report. Be clear,
      concise, and complete. Point out what you expected and what you are seeing instead. Explain
      what the problem is based on a use case. Keep the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/">HTML Design Principles</a> in mind
      (even if your bug has nothing to do with HTML), notably the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies">Priority of
      Constituencies</a>. Be kind and polite (<a href="/docs/policy/anti-jerk.html">or else</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      There is only one small complicating factor compared to a typical bug report. Some WebSpecs
      will be forks of others, and in some situations the bug would be better filed on another one.
      If the distinction is obvious to you, just keep it in mind, otherwise just file on the
      document you were reading and people will move it if need be — better a bug in the wrong place
      than missed.
