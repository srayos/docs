      You want to jump in and actually write some text, either from scratch or as a modification to
      someone else’s work. The details are on this page.

    <dt><a href="https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed/tree/master/docs">Bikeshed — Markdown for WebSpecs</a></dt>
    <dd>
      WebSpecs can be written using a Markdown flavour known as “Bikeshed” that happens to have a lot
      of tricks up its sleeve that comes in handy when producing a specification. There’s a lot that
      can be known about Bikeshed, but you don’t need to learn more than the very basics in order
      to get started — and the rest ought to come easy.
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="http://w3.org/respec/">ReSpec — HTML for WebSpecs</a></dt>
    <dd>
      If you prefer HTML and JS to Markdown, WebSpecs can also be written using ReSpec. Like
      Bikeshed it takes care of a lot of the things you don’t want to have to think about. You can
      start from <a href="http://www.w3.org/respec/examples/minimal-w3c.html">a very basic
      example</a> and only tweak the configuration (near the top of the source) to set 
      <code>specStatus</code> to <code>"webspec"</code> and <code>repository</code> to the
      <code>user/repo-name</code> string that fits your specification. Call the file
      <code>index.src.html</code> and you’re good to go! It should look like
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/respec/examples/minimal-w3c.html?specStatus=webspec;repository=w3c/respec-docs">this
      very basic example</a>, which is in fact the same as linked right above but with its
      configuration overridden in the query string.
