    <dd>
      WebSpecs are written using a Markdown flavour known as “Bikeshed” that happens to have a lot
      of tricks up its sleeve that comes in handy when producing a specification. There’s a lot that
      can be known about Bikeshed, but you don’t need to learn more than the very basics in order
      to get started — and the rest ought to come easy.
