    There are essentially three cases in which you will want to handle your own repository of a
    specification.
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Relatively simple correction or change</dt>
    <dd>
      You have found an issue or have a relatively straightforward improvement to make to an
      existing specification. You do so by forking the specification, modifying it in a branch, and
      making a pull-request against the original. No specific knowledge is required beyond the
      basics of git and GitHub, and the format used for specifications (for which links are provided
      below).This is exactly the same process as for any open source project on GitHub.
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="#forking">Forking</a></dt>
    <dd>
      You disagree with part of an existing specification or you wish to propose a relatively large
      new feature or change of behaviour. It is likely that your proposal would not be accepted
      immediately but would require discussion in the community, likely leading to some changes
      along the way. In this case you will want to not only fork the specification, but also
      publish it on WebSpecs so that others can review it. This is explained below.
    </dd>
    <dt><a href="#scratch">Starting From Scratch</a></dt>
    <dd>
      You have a completely new idea for a specification and you wish to publish it as a WebSpec.
      Simply follow the instructions in the corresponding section below and you will be good to go.
      Note that before embarking on this it is <strong>strongly</strong> recommended that you first
      discuss the issue on <a href="http://discourse.specifiction.org/">Discourse</a> as it is
      likely that you will receive useful feedback and guidance from the community there that could
      save you a lot of work down the line.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <section>
    <h2 id="forking">Forking</h2>
    <p>
      Simply fork the repository for the specification of interest into a new one that you have 
      write access to. It absolutely does not need to be under the
      <a href="https://github.com/webspecs/">WebSpecs</a> organisation at GitHub. It doesn't matter
      if you are forking a fork (of a fork of a fork), simply pick the most logical starting point
      for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Check it out and create a new topic branch. The rule for branches is very simple:
      <code>master</code> is for things that have shipped in implementations and are well-tested, and
      <code>develop</code> is for stuff that doesn't yet pass tests but that does have clear
      implementation commitments from browser vendors. If not in either of the previous two
      categories, just pick a self-descriptive name that you like.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will then need to edit your specification. WebSpecs can come in two formats. If you see a
      file called <code>index.bs</code> (or other <code>*.bs</code> file name variant, though those
      are discouraged) then the syntax is “Bikeshed”. If there’s an <code>index.src.html</code> file
      (or, again, <code>*.src.html</code> variants are technically possible but as of this writing
      there actually aren’t any) then the format is “ReSpec”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bikeshed is a Markdown flavour popular for specification writing and for which you can <a href="https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed/tree/master/docs">read documentation online</a>.
      If you are familiar with Markdown you ought to find Bikeshed easy. If you are of those who
      hate Markdown, do not despair: the alternative is an HTML-based format.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you use Bikeshed, it is recommended to have a copy of Bikeshed installed (preferably in a
      directory parallel to the specifications you are working on) but it is not required.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you prefer HTML and JS to Markdown, WebSpecs can also be written using <a href="http://www.w3.org/respec/">ReSpec</a>. Like Bikeshed it takes care of a lot of the
      things you don’t want to have to think about. You can start from <a href="http://www.w3.org/respec/examples/minimal-w3c.html">a very basic example</a> and only
      tweak the configuration (near the top of the source) to set <code>specStatus</code> to
      <code>"webspec"</code> and <code>repository</code> to the <code>user/repo-name</code> string
      that fits your specification. Call the file <code>index.src.html</code> and you’re good to go!
      It should look like <a href="http://www.w3.org/respec/examples/minimal-w3c.html?specStatus=webspec;repository=w3c/respec-docs">this
      very basic example</a>, which is in fact the same as linked right above but with its
      configuration overridden in the query string.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make changes, push them, etc. Once you want to publish your work to the community, simply
      make a pull-request against <a href="https://github.com/webspecs/the-index">the-index</a>.
      That is the document that sits at the root of 
      <a href="https://specs.webplatform.org/">https://specs.webplatform.org/</a> and which drives
      the automatic publishing system. For a fork you will mostly just want to add a pointer to your own
      <code>user/repo#branch</code>. When your PR is reviewed, in order to ensure that your fork is
      automatically published whenever you make changes to it you just need to create a Web hook in
      your GitHub repository that points to <code>http://publican.berjon.com/hook</code>. Once your
      PR is accepted, the WebSpecs index will be updated and your specification will be published.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's it!
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2 id="scratch">Starting From Scratch</h2>
    <p>
      The process for starting from scratch is substantially the same as the process for forking,
      except of course that you have to set up the initial repository yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin with, create a repository in the usual way, wherever you want. Pick a name for it
      that is descriptive (avoid silly, because that tends to stick). Clone it locally, and create
      a branch according to the guidelines presented in the previous section.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will want to install the <code>webspec</code> tool, which is straightforward: <code>npm
      install -g webspec</code>. Note: in the close future this tool will be replace with a simpler
      Web interface that carries out the same basic tasks. Also, the current tool does not support
      all the nice features that are available, don’t hesitate to just ask for help setting up until
      the Web tool is ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      As indicated in the previous section, if you’re using Bikeshed it is a good idea to clone it
      in a directory parallel to the ones in which you edit specifications. While not required (the
      source gets regenerated at publish time anyway) it allows you to check that you don't have
      errors in your draft.
    </p>
    <p>
      For ReSpec, the generation is done in the browser so there is nothing to install. When you
      load your <code>index.src.html</code> in your browser, a little “ReSpec” pill shows up in the
      top right corner of the page (which isn't present in the published version of the document).
      If there are errors with your specification, they’ll be reported there.
    </p>
    <p>
      While at the root of your specification's directory, type <code>webspec new</code> and follow
      the instructions. (Note: the current default license of "CC0" will soon change across the
      board, for ReSpec documents it is already a new option.)
    </p>
    <p>
      This should give you a specification that's ready to go! At this point you are ready to make
      a pull-request against <a href="https://github.com/webspecs/the-index">the-index</a> to add a
      section briefly describing your specification (copy freely from the others) and pointing to
      your <code>user/repo#branch</code>. When your PR is reviewed, in order to ensure that your
      fork is automatically published whenever you make changes to it you just need to create a Web
      hook in your GitHub repository that points to <code>http://publican.berjon.com/hook</code>.
      Once your PR is accepted, the WebSpecs index will be updated and your specification will be
      published. You're good to go!

    <h2 id="help">Getting Help</h2>
    <p>
      The easiest way to get help is to join us on IRC, channel
      <a href="irc://freenode.net/webspecs">#webspecs on the Freenode.net network</a>. It's a
      helpful bunch. If you are certain that the issue is with a tool, file an issue on GitHub.
      There are more options listed in <a href="/docs/#community">Community &amp; Support</a>, and
      if all else fails you can email <a href="mailto:robin@berjon.com">Robin</a>.
