    Web standards have flourished in large part through their openness. A core tenet of WebSpecs
    is to create standards that are fully open, matching the needs and habits of the Web
    community. The Web is a commons, should be managed as such.
  </p>
  <p>
    This builds on the following principles that Web Platform Specs should be:
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt id="hackable">Hackable</dt>
    <dd>
      The tools required in order to contribute to specifications should be available as open
      source. For all that this may seem obvious, it is not always the case. What’s more, as much as
      possible they should rely on conventions that are familiar to Web developers so as to ensure
      that the barrier to entry is as low as possible.

    <dt id="forkable">Forkable</dt>
    <dd>
      Up until a few years ago, forking was perceived as a mode of failure. Today, it is a mode of
      collaboration: <em>Make Forks Not War</em>. All WebSpecs are available under the most
      permissive forkable license.
    </dd>
    <dt id="thoughtful">Thoughtful</dt>
    <dd>
      Standard organisations often start off flexible and smart, but over time collectively suffer
      from a slow, toxic drift towards dumb adherence to rules over thoughtful consideration of
      goals. It is a continuing goal of WebSpecs to avoid this drift, to keep the amount of rules
      to a strict minimum, and to always leave room for intelligent discussion amongst smart,
      constructive adults.
    </dd>
    <dt id="rf">Royalty-Free</dt>
    <dd>
      The W3C’s Royalty-Free policy has been a major contributor in keeping the Web open for all,
      and all that WebSpecs produces must be compatible with it. All repositories are placed under
      an RF contribution policy that makes direct use of the W3C’s legal infrastructure.
    </dd>
    <dt id="software-practices">Software Practices</dt>
    <dd>
      Standards have a lot in common with software, they should be managed in a similar manner that
      learns from common experience in that field. Notably, the git branching model should enable
      the classic separation between releases, nightly, and topic branches.
    </dd>
    <dt id="tested">Tested</dt>
    <dd>
      There is only one difference between a WebSpecs specification sitting in a topic branch and 
      one that’s taken into the <code>master</code> branch: testing. If a specification
      has a good enough (for sane values of “good enough”, perfection not being of this world) 
      test suite in our sister <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/">Web Platform
      Tests</a> project and that test suite has a <em>good enough</em> pass ratio in at least a
      couple of major browsers, then that specification is good to merge to <code>master</code>.
      If it is being implemented but isn’t yet tested well enough, it’s in <code>develop</code>.
      Otherwise, it’s a proposal.
