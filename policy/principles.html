    Web standards have flourished in large part through their openness. A core tenet of WebSpecs
    is to create standards that are fully open, matching the needs and habits of the Web
    community. This builds on the following principles:

      Up until a few years ago, forking was perceived as a mode of failure. Today, it is a mode of
      collaboration: <em>Make Forks Not War</em>.

      Standard organisations often start off flexible and smart, but over time collectively suffer
      from a slow, toxic drift towards dumb adherence to rules over thoughtful consideration of
      goals. It is a continuing goal of WebSpecs to avoid this drift, to keep the amount of rules
      to a strict minimum, and to always leave room for intelligent discussion amongst smart,
      constructive adults.

      There is only one difference between a WebSpecs specification sitting in a topic branch or
      on anyone’s fork and one that’s taken into the <code>master</code> branch of a 
      <a href="https://github.com/webspecs">webspecs repository</a>: testing. If a specification
      has a good enough (for sane values of “good enough”, perfection not being of this world) 
      test suite in our sister <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/">Web Platform
      Tests</a> project and that test suite has a <em>good enough</em> pass ratio in at least a
      couple of major browsers, then that specification is good to merge to <code>master</code>.
      Otherwise, it’s a proposal.
