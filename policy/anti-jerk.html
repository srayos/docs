    The core of our anti-jerk policy is pretty simple: <strong>don’t be a jerk</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, if that were enough of a policy to weed jerks out of a community, it’d be a universal
    rule of the Internet by now. But there is an important component to take away here: if someone
    is being a jerk to you, we’ve got your back. If you see someone being a jerk to another member,
    just let us know and we’ve got their back.
  </p>
  <p>
    If, on the other hand, you insist on being a jerk to others then we reserve the right to fight
    you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_keWS1i3RA"><em>to the pain</em></a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Web Platform Specs is a harassment-free project. We will not tolerate harassment of any form,
    including related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
    race, fur length, or religion.
  </p>
  <p>
    People are frequently <a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">wrong on the Internet</a>. All the same,
    they are to be treated with respect. If you can’t find a constructive, helpful way in which to
    formulate your disagreement then most likely you don’t yourself have clear position to start
    with. Hint: if you find yourself constantly repeating the same point while others keep providing
    you with kind and helpful push-back, the odds are the jerk in the conversation is you. That’s
    okay, we’ve all been there. Just take a deep breath and move on.
  </p>

    This <a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2939">helpful SMBC analysis of debating in
    general</a> is strongly recommended reading.
  </p>
  <p>
    Standards communities also have their own specific type of jerk that is worth mentioning here:
    the Process Jerk. A Process Jerk will find every manner and form of reason to block process by
    arguing process points, because they are seemingly unable to understand the fact that rules are
    made to fix problems, not to create them. Remember: be <a href="principles.html#thoughtful">thoughtful</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Process Jerks will be dealt with with inane brutality.
